        <h3>Us in a Nutshell</h3> 
        <p>
            We are outdoor enthusiasts, who love spending the majority of our time in nature. Our story starts with a family road-trip down the coast. We wanted to get away for a weekend and decided a drive down the coast was the perfect small vacay we needed. As we traveled down the coast from Seattle, we landed in the charming bustling city of San Francisco. Immediately falling in love with the culture and more importantly the sunshine (although we've come to learn this can be limited), we decided this is where we wanted to be. But we didn't want another boring 9-5 out of an office. We wanted to do something that would be fun everyday and allow us to enjoy what we love most (besides each other); nature.

        <h3>Our Philosohpy</h3>
        <p>
            Too often, we are so concerned about making it somewhere, but don't take the time to really enjoy the journey. We believe everyone should have the time to reset their mental and physical being, and vacations should be a universal given. When booking a stay with us, we value making the process easy and free of worry. Let us make your stay uber comfortable and stress free.
